I was particularly proud of this site, which was one of my first projects at Tidal where I owned both the front-end and back-end development.</p><p>I built out the site on our custom PHP/MongoDB CMS, implemented lightbox and carousel plugins, and wrote custom Javascript to interface with the faceted search navigation.</p>",
