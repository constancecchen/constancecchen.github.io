  "description": "<p>A simple event-focused WordPress theme for Seattle's indie video game development community, which I volunteer for and help organize. I was responsible for the design and development of this theme, including migrating the old site over from Squarespace, and maintain it to this day.</p><p>Particularly noteworthy about the site is its extensive use of social APIs. Apart from the blog, the site mostly acts a hub for the various social platforms the organization leverages - such as Facebook, Google Calendar, and Meetup.</p>",
