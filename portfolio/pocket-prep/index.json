  "description": "<p>Pocket Prep was a delightful website redesign for an app company based in Seattle. I was able to fully own the development of the site, from static HTML to WordPress template, as well as work directly with the client throughout the process.</p><p>I was particularly proud of this project due to this sense of ownership and the client's praise for the final product's polish and ease of use in the admin dashboard. I also greatly enjoyed learning about and implementing custom post types, advanced custom fields and repeaters, and the MixItUp jQuery library.</p>",
