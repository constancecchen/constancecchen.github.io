				<h3>If I have a question about my bill or how much my procedure at Summit Surgery Center will be, who should I talk to?</h3>
				<p>Please call the MedBridge Patient Services Department at  855-633-2743 M-F 8am-5pm. This is a toll-free number, so it won’t cost you anything to call.</p>

				<h3>How do you determine patient portion costs?</h3>
				<p>Summit Surgery Center is contracted with several insurance companies. These contracts specify how much money your insurance will allow as payable for a procedure. MedBridge will assess the insurance contract and your plan benefits to estimate your patient portion.  If your insurance is out-of-network at our facility, we will do our best to set your patient portion based on your in-network benefits.</p>

				<h3>When will I be expected to pay the amount that is my responsibility?</h3>
				<p>You are expected to pay at least part of your patient portion on the date of surgery. If you will not be able to make the payment at that time, please contact MedBridge at 855-633-2743 BEFORE the date of your surgery to discuss your options and to set up a payment plan.</p>

				<h3>Why am I asked to pay on the day of service?</h3>
				<p>In keeping with the terms of your agreement with your insurance company, as well as the agreement between the insurance company and Summit Surgery Center, it is our practice to request that you pay at least part of the facility fee on the date of service.</p>

				<p>MedBridge does their best to provide you with an estimated facility fee before you receive services. This gives you the opportunity to understand how your health insurance will be applied to the services you receive at Summit. Feel free to ask MedBridge specific questions about your insurance benefits as well as payment plan options.</p>

				<h3>What is a “co-payment”?</h3>
				<p>A co-payment (often called “co-pay”) is a set fee that the insured person pays to providers at the time of service. Co-pays are applied to emergency room visits, hospital admissions, outpatient surgeries, office visits, etc.</p>

				<h3>What is a “deductible”?</h3>
				<p>Deductibles are provisions that require the insured person to pay a specified amount before insurance benefits are provided. For example, if your policy has a $500 deductible, you must accumulate and pay $500 out-of-pocket before your insurance will begin paying a percentage of service charges. Once you have accumulated and paid your $500 deductible to your medical providers, your insurance plan will start paying a percentage of future medical bills. You are thereafter responsible for your coinsurance. Deductibles typically re-set annually.</p>

				<h3>What is “co-insurance”?</h3>
				<p>Co-insurance is a form of cost sharing. After your deductible has been met, your insurance plan will begin paying a percentage of your bill. After your insurance has processed the claim and paid the percentage determined by your plan benefits, you will owe the remaining percentage, or “co-insurance.”</p>

				<h3>What do the terms “in-network” and “out-of-network” mean?</h3>
				<p>If you have selected a PPO plan, you will have both in and out of network coverage. Healthcare providers that participate in your health plan are often referred to as “in-network,” and providers that do NOT participate in your health plan may be referred to as “out-of-network.” If Summit Surgery Center is out-of-network, we will check both your in- and out-of-network benefits and do our best to offer a facility fee that is comparable to an in-network provider.</p>

				<h3>Will Summit Surgery Center submit claims to my primary and secondary insurance?</h3>
				<p>As a courtesy to our patients, we submit claims to your primary and secondary insurance companies. We will do everything we can to advance your claim, and will contact you if we need your involvement in the process.</p>

				<h3>What is an “Explanation of Benefits” (EOB)?</h3>
				<p>An EOB, or Explanation of Benefits, is a letter from your insurance company that provides information about how insurance processed your claim. If you have any questions about your EOB, please call MedBridge.</p>

				<h3>What should I do if the insurance company sends payment directly to me?</h3>
				<p>If you receive a check from your insurance company, please immediately call MedBridge at 855-MEDBRIDGE. We will ask you to endorse the check to Summit and send it directly to our office. It is very important that you endorse this check immediately to Summit: it is money due to the facility and is not to be used for any other purpose.</p>

				<h3>How and where can I pay my bill? What forms of payment are accepted?</h3>
				<p>You can pay:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>By telephone with a credit or debit card by calling MedBridge at (855)-MEDBRIDGE</li>
					<li>By mail by sending your billing statement and payment (by check, credit or debit card) to Summit Surgery Center, 121 Gray Ave., Suite 200, Santa Barbara, CA 93101</li>
					<li>In person at Summit Surgery Center (by cash, check, credit or debit card)</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Do you balance bill?</h3>
				<p>No. Our practice does not balance bill. If insurance does not pay the full-billed amount, we will not bill you for what insurance did not pay. You will owe the amount that is discussed with you prior to surgery.</p>
