# Fashion Indie

A stylish fashion blog with a focus on gorgeous imagery and image carousels. I enjoyed the continuity and ownership I had with this project, as I implemented several of its redesigns and was responsible for its maintenance and client requests.

## Disclaimer

(Static site / code samples are currently being polished and will be uploaded soon. Stay tuned!)

As live sites are guaranteed to change over time (whether they get redesigned or shut down), I have preserved a static copy of the original design & code for preview purposes. Please note that this is therefore an archive, and does not necessarily represent my latest skillset.
