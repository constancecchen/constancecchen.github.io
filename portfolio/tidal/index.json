Initially, our team built out a full web app with marketplace/user logic, but eventually transitioned over to a more traditional landing site.</p><p>I oversaw the Tidal site through multiple redesigns and revisions. Primarily I owned the front-end stack, wrote our CSS style guide, and provided input for UI/UX decisions - all while learning PHP/Laravel, contributing to the back-end, and collaborating with both designers and marketing content producers.</p>",
