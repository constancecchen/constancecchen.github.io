# Today Parenting Team

Our company worked closely with the Today Show to create online communities where their viewers could participate, engage, and share knowledge. My responsibility was converting Today's designs into static HTML, and handing off assets to other developers for build-out and maintenance.

## Disclaimer

(Static site / code samples are currently being polished and will be uploaded soon. Stay tuned!)

As live sites are guaranteed to change over time (whether they get redesigned or shut down), I have preserved a static copy of the original design & code for preview purposes. Please note that this is therefore an archive, and does not necessarily represent my latest skillset.
