Bird Box Science was designed and created in two days for Bellevue Startup Weekend 2014, as a static mock-up of a social network page and product landing page. The product vision and team took first place, and the majority of them went on to develop the concept into a Kickstarter.

## Disclaimer

As live sites are guaranteed to change over time (whether they get redesigned or shut down), I have preserved a static copy of the original design & code for preview purposes. Please note that this is therefore an archive, and does not necessarily represent my latest skillset.
