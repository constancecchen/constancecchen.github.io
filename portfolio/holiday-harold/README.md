Holiday Harold was a fun and tongue-in-cheek one-page mini-site created for our agency's marketing and customer outreach. Our designers' imaginations ran wild, and I had the enormous pleasure of bringing their illustrations to life with CSS3 animation.

As live sites are guaranteed to change over time (whether they get redesigned or shut down), I have preserved a static copy of the original design & code for preview purposes. Please note that this is therefore an archive, and does not necessarily represent my latest skillset.
