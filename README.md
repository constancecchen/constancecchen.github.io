# constancecchen.github.io

My personal dev site, which I plan to continuously improve and update.

### To Do:

- Turn the resume into an actual page, instead of a PDF
- [Prevent FOUT](https://viget.com/extend/the-font-face-dilemma)
- Add a seperate page for all work, not just recent(?)
- Add a teaser section for my recent creative works
- Rewrite copy to perhaps be more informative. Look around at other dev pages to see how they handle succinctness versus personality and so forth.
